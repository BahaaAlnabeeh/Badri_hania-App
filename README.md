# Badri_hania-App

It is an application for Badri and Haniyeh Company, it was programmed to help the company follow up on its customers and distributors in an advanced and easy way, and the application is built to be used whether there is an Internet connection or not, it synchronizes customers only once when logging in and then they are stored in the local storage and also When it is used without connecting to the Internet, it stores operations until it is connected to the Internet, and then when connected to the Internet, all operations are performed automatically.

When login It is determined whether the user is a field customer follow-up employee or a distributor, and then the customers are automatically synchronized from the server, only once upon logging in, and then the customers are automatically saved in the local storage to be accessed without the need to connect to the Internet, so if The user was a customer follow-up employee, so he showed him all the customers on the map, and if the user was a distributor, he showed him his own customers only. 

The distributor visits his own customers when clicking on daily customers, and there are also urgent customers, if the customer must be visited urgently because of the presence of An urgent matter, also there are notifications in the application, so if a customer is added, a notification is sent to the private distributor to whom the customer was added to be informed that a new customer has been added, and based on the notification, the customer is automatically stored in the local, and therefore the distributor does not need to synchronize the customers again Also, a notification is sent if a customer is deleted to be deleted from local storage, and there are several other notifications based on which an order is executed, and there are several actions and operations in the application, all of which are stored in the local if there is no internet connection, and when connected, they are executed and sent to the server automatically without the intervention of the distributor.
